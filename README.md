# Introduction
This project contains an airline management database with tables for storing employee, flight, passenger, and airport information. The SQL code includes table creation statements and sample data insertion statements. It is about extracting flight data (facts) and additional information (dimensions) from given data. I implemented the timespamp, join, window function, rank function to extract the queries.
